	abstract = {Summary Lymphomas are solid tumours of the immune system. Hodgkin's lymphoma accounts for about 10% of all lymphomas, and the remaining 90% are referred to as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas have a wide range of histological appearances and clinical features at presentation, which can make diagnosis difficult. Lymphomas are not rare, and most physicians, irrespective of their specialty, will probably have come across a patient with lymphoma. Timely diagnosis is important because effective, and often curative, therapies are available for many subtypes. In this Seminar we discuss advances in the understanding of the biology of these malignancies and new, available treatments.},

	abstract = {Objectives United States government scientists estimate that COVID-19 may kill tens of thousands of Americans. Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States.Design A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data.Data sources COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98\% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center.Main outcome measures We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state{\textquoteright}s issuance of stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses.Results We found that an increase of only 1 μg/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8\% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2\%, 15\%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses.Conclusions A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The data and code are publicly available so our analyses can be updated routinely.What is already known on this topicLong-term exposure to PM2.5 is linked to many of the comorbidities that have been associated with poor prognosis and death in COVID-19 patients, including cardiovascular and lung disease.PM2.5 exposure is associated with increased risk of severe outcomes in patients with certain infectious respiratory diseases, including influenza, pneumonia, and SARS.Air pollution exposure is known to cause inflammation and cellular damage, and evidence suggests that it may suppress early immune response to infection.What this study addsThis is the first nationwide study of the relationship between historical exposure to air pollution exposure and COVID-19 death rate, relying on data from more than 3,000 counties in the United States. The results suggest that long-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates, after adjustment for a wide range of socioeconomic, demographic, weather, behavioral, epidemic stage, and healthcare-related confounders.This study relies entirely on publicly available data and fully reproducible, public code to facilitate continued investigation of these relationships by the broader scientific community as the COVID-19 outbreak evolves and more data become available.What this study addsA small increase in long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with a substantial increase in the county{\textquoteright}s COVID-19 mortality rate up to April 22, 2020.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was made possible by the support from the NIH grant R01 ES024332-01A1, P50MD010428, ES024012, ES026217, ES028033; MD012769, HEI grant 4953-RFA14-3/16-4, and USEPA grants 83587201-0, RD-83479801.

Both criteria may be viewed as estimators of the expected Kullback-Leibler information. The bias of AIC and AICC is studied in the underfitting case, where none of the candidate models includes the true model (Shibata, 1980, 1981; Parzen, 1978). Both normal linear regression and autoregressive candidate models are considered. The bias of AICC is typically smaller, often dramatically smaller, than that of AIC. A simulation study in which the true model is an infinite-order autoregression shows that, even in moderate sample sizes, AICC provides substantially better model selections than AIC.}},

@article{Hurvich_1998,
	abstract = {Many different methods have been proposed to construct nonparametric estimates of a smooth regression function, including local polynomial, (convolution) kernel and smoothing spline estimators. Each of these estimators uses a smoothing parameter to control the amount of smoothing performed on a given data set. In this paper an improved version of a criterion based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), termed AICC, is derived and examined as a way to choose the smoothing parameter. Unlike plug-in methods, AICC can be used to choose smoothing parameters for any linear smoother, including local quadratic and smoothing spline estimators. The use of AICC avoids the large variability and tendency to undersmooth (compared with the actual minimizer of average squared error) seen when other `classical' approaches (such as generalized cross-validation (GCV) or the AIC) are used to choose the smoothing parameter. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the AICC-based smoothing parameter is competitive with a plug-in method (assuming that one exists) when the plug-in method works well but also performs well when the plug-in approach fails or is unavailable.},

	abstract = {Background: Rectal cancer has been previously associated with exposure to metalworking fluids in a cohort mortality study of autoworkers. Objective: To better specify the exposure{\textendash}response relationship with straight metalworking fluids (mineral oils) by applying non-parametric regression methods that avoid linearity constraints and arbitrary exposure cut points and by lagging exposure to account for cancer latency, in a nested case{\textendash}control analysis. Methods: In addition to the classical Poisson regression with categorical exposure, survival models with penalised splines were used to estimate the exposure{\textendash}response relationship between cumulative exposure to straight metalworking fluid and mortality from rectal cancer. Exposures to water-based metalworking fluids were treated as potential confounders, and all exposures were lagged by 5, 10, 15 and 20 years to account for cancer latency. The influence of the highest exposures was dealt with by a log transformation and outlier removal. The sensitivity of the penalised splines to alternative criteria for model selection and to the placement of knots was also examined. Results: The hazard ratio for mortality from rectal cancer increased essentially linearly with cumulative exposure to straight metalworking fluid (with narrow confidence bands) up to a maximum of 2.2 at the 99th centile of exposure and then decreased (with wide confidence bands). Lagging exposure up to 15 years increased the initial steepness of the curve and raised the maximum hazard ratio to 3.2. Conclusions: Non-parametric smoothing of lagged exposures has shown stronger evidence for a causal association between straight metalworking fluid and rectal cancer than was previously described using standard analytical methods. This analysis suggests an exposure{\textendash}response trend that is close to linear and statistically significant over most of the exposure range and that increases further with lagged exposures. Smoothing should be regularly applied to environmental studies with quantitative exposure estimates to refine characterisation of the dose{\textendash}response relationship.},

@article{Kaufman_2020,
	abstract = {Background Social welfare policies such as the minimum wage can affect population health, though the impact may differ by the level of unemployment experienced by society at a given time.Methods We ran difference-in-differences models using monthly data from all 50 states and Washington, DC from 1990 to 2015. We used educational attainment to define treatment and control groups. The exposure was the difference between state and federal minimum wage in US$2015, defined both by the date the state law became effective and lagged by 1 year. Models included state and year fixed effects, and additional state-level covariates to account for state-specific time-varying confounding. We assessed effect modification by the state-level unemployment rate, and estimated predicted suicide counts under different minimum wage scenarios.Results The effect of a US$1 increase in the minimum wage ranged from a 3.4\% decrease (95\% CI 0.4 to 6.4) to a 5.9\% decrease (95\% CI 1.4 to 10.2) in the suicide rate among adults aged 18{\textendash}64 years with a high school education or less. We detected significant effect modification by unemployment rate, with the largest effects of minimum wage on reducing suicides observed at higher unemployment levels.Conclusion Minimum wage increases appear to reduce the suicide rate among those with a high school education or less, and may reduce disparities between socioeconomic groups. Effects appear greatest during periods of high unemployment.},

@article{Stegherr_2020,
	abstract = {Both delayed study entry (left-truncation) and competing risks are common phenomena in observational time-to-event studies. For example, in studies conducted by Teratology Information Services (TIS) on adverse drug reactions during pregnancy, the natural time scale is gestational age, but women enter the study after time origin and upon contact with the service. Competing risks are present, because an elective termination may be precluded by a spontaneous abortion. If left-truncation is entirely random, the Aalen-Johansen estimator is the canonical estimator of the cumulative incidence functions of the competing events. If the assumption of random left-truncation is in doubt, we propose a new semiparametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function. The dependence between entry time and time-to-event is modeled using a cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model and the marginal (unconditional) estimates are derived via inverse probability weighting arguments. We apply the new estimator to data about coumarin usage during pregnancy. Here, the concern is that the cause-specific hazard of experiencing an induced abortion may depend on the time when seeking advice by a TIS, which also is the time of left-truncation or study entry. While the aims of counseling by a TIS are to reduce the rate of elective terminations based on irrational overestimation of drug risks and to lead to better and safer medical treatment of maternal disease, it is conceivable that women considering an induced abortion are more likely to seek counseling. The new estimator is also evaluated in extensive simulation studies and found preferable compared to the Aalen-Johansen estimator in non--misspecified scenarios and to at least provide for a sensitivity analysis otherwise.},

@article{Eisen_2020,
	abstract = {Background In recent decades, suicide and fatal overdose rates have increased in the US, particularly for working-age adults with no college education. The coincident decline in manufacturing has limited stable employment options for this population. Erosion of the Michigan automobile industry provides a striking case study.Methods We used individual-level data from a retrospective cohort study of 26~804 autoworkers in the United Autoworkers-General Motors cohort, using employment records from 1970 to 1994 and mortality follow-up from 1970 to 2015. We estimated HRs for suicide or fatal overdose in relation to leaving work, measured as active or inactive employment status and age at worker exit.Results There were 257 deaths due to either suicide (n=202) or overdose (n=55); all but 21 events occurred after leaving work. The hazard rate for suicide was 16.1 times higher for inactive versus active workers (95\% CI 9.8 to 26.5). HRs for suicide were elevated for all younger age groups relative to those leaving work after age 55. Those 30{\textendash}39~years old at exit had the highest HR for suicide, 1.9 (95\% CI 1.2 to 3.0). When overdose was included, the rate increased by twofold for both 19- to 29-year-olds and 30- to 39-year-olds at exit. Risks remained elevated when follow-up was restricted to 5 years after exit.Conclusions Autoworkers who left work had a higher risk of suicide or overdose than active employees. Those who left before retirement age had higher rates than those who left after, suggesting that leaving work early may increase the risk.},

@article{Costello_2020,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This report describes the extended follow-up (1941--2015) of a cohort of 38 649 automobile manufacturing workers with potential exposure to metalworking fluids (MWF). The outcomes of interest were mortality from cancers of the esophagus, stomach, intestine, rectum, bladder, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, skin, prostate, brain, and female breast, as well as leukemia. This report includes 5472 deaths from cancer, more than ten times the numbers of deaths in our last summary report published 20 years ago.

METHODS: Standardized mortality ratios were computed for the entire study period. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were estimated in Cox proportional hazard models with categorical variables for cumulative exposure to each type of MWF.

RESULTS: Exposure--response patterns are consistent with prior mortality reports from this cohort. We found increased risk of skin and female breast cancer with straight fluids. For the first time, we found elevated risk of stomach cancer mortality. Overall, many of the exposure--response results did not suggest an association with MWF.

CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is a poor proxy for cancer diagnosis for treatable cancers and not the optimal outcome measure in etiological studies. Although the HR presented here handle bias from the healthy worker hire effect and left truncation, they do not handle bias from healthy worker survivor effect, which likely results in underestimates of the health impacts of MWF. Although this updated summary provides some information on the risk of cancer from MWF, targeted future analyses will help clarify associations.},

Unlike standard regression approaches, the parametric g-formula can be used to adjust for time-varying confounders that are affected by prior exposures. To date, there are few published examples in which the method has been applied. Methods: We provide a simple introduction to the parametric g-formula and illustrate its application in an analysis of a small cohort study of bone marrow transplant patients in which the effect of treatment on mortality is subject to time-varying confounding. Results: Standard regression adjustment yields a biased estimate of the effect of treatment on mortality relative to the estimate obtained by the g-formula. Conclusions: The g-formula allows estimation of a relevant parameter for public health officials: the change in the hazard of mortality under a hypothetical intervention, such as reduction of exposure to a harmful agent or introduction of a beneficial new treatment. We present a simple approach to implement the parametric g-formula that is sufficiently general to allow easy adaptation to many settings of public health relevance.},

	abstract = { The assumption of positivity or experimental treatment assignment requires that observed treatment levels vary within confounder strata. This article discusses the positivity assumption in the context of assessing model and parameter-specific identifiability of causal effects. Positivity violations occur when certain subgroups in a sample rarely or never receive some treatments of interest. The resulting sparsity in the data may increase bias with or without an increase in variance and can threaten valid inference. The parametric bootstrap is presented as a tool to assess the severity of such threats and its utility as a diagnostic is explored using simulated and real data. Several approaches for improving the identifiability of parameters in the presence of positivity violations are reviewed. Potential responses to data sparsity include restriction of the covariate adjustment set, use of an alternative projection function to define the target parameter within a marginal structural working model, restriction of the sample, and modification of the target intervention. All of these approaches can be understood as trading off proximity to the initial target of inference for identifiability; we advocate approaching this tradeoff systematically. },

We describe cases in which intuition concerning signed edges fails and we characterize the directed acyclic graphs that researchers can use to draw conclusions about the sign of the bias of unmeasured confounding. If there is only one unmeasured confounding variable on the graph, then nonincreasing or nondecreasing average causal effects suffice to draw conclusions about the direction of the bias. When there are more than one unmeasured confounding variable, nonincreasing and nondecreasing average causal effects can be used to draw conclusions only if the various unmeasured confounding variables are independent of one another conditional on the measured covariates.

	abstract = {Abstract Background In the absence of unmeasured confounding factors and model misspecification, standard methods for estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatments on survival are biased when (i) there exists a time-dependent risk factor for survival that also predicts subsequent treatment and (ii) past treatment history predicts subsequent risk factor level. In contrast, structural models provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. The parameters of nested structural models are estimated by g-estimation and those of marginal structural models by inverse probability weighting. Methods We describe a nested structural accelerated failure time model and use it to estimate the total causal effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the time to AIDS or death among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort and Women's Interagency HIV Studies. The Appendix describes g-estimation and methods to deal with censoring. Results Comparing the regime `always treated' to `never treated,' the AIDS-free survival time ratio was 2.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7, 3.3). Conclusions Our finding of a strongly beneficial effect is consistent with results from randomized trials and from a previous analysis of the same data using a marginal structural Cox model. In contrast, a previous analysis using a standard (non-structural) model did not find an effect of treatment on survival. Copyright {\copyright} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Robins_1986,
	abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect.},

@article{Araki_2020,
	abstract = {Background
Phthalate esters and phosphate flame retardants and plasticizers (PFRs) are both used as plasticizers and are commonly detected in indoor environments. Although both phthalates and PFRs are known to be associated with children's wheeze and allergic symptoms, there have been no previous studies examining the effects of mixtures of these exposures.
Objectives
To investigate the association between exposure to mixtures of phthalate esters and PFRs, and wheeze and allergic symptoms among school-aged children.
Methods
A total of 128 elementary school-aged children were enrolled. Metabolites of 3 phthalate esters and 7 PFRs were measured in urine samples. Parent-reported symptoms of wheeze, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema were evaluated using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. In the primary model, we created a phthalate ester and PFR mixture exposure index, and estimated odds ratios (ORs) using weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and quantile g (qg)-computation. The two highest chemicals according to qg-computation weight %s were combined to create a combination high × high exposure estimate, with ORs calculated using the ``low × low'' exposure group as the reference category. Concentrations of each metabolite were corrected by multiplying this value by the sex- and body size-Standardised creatinine concentration and dividing by the observed creatinine value. All models were adjusted for sex, grade, dampness index and annual house income.
Results
The odds ratio of rhinoconjunctivitis for the association between exposure to chemical mixtures according to the WQS index positive models was; OR = 2.60 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-5.14). However, wheeze and eczema of the WQS index positive model, none of the WQS index negative models or qg-computation result yielded statistically significant results. Combined exposure to the two highest WQS weight %s of ``high-high'' ΣTCIPP and ΣTPHP was associated with an increased prevalence of rhino-conjunctivitis, OR = 5.78 (1.81--18.43) to the ``low × low'' group.
Conclusions
Significant associations of mixed exposures to phthalates and PFRs and increased prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis was found among elementary school-aged children in the WQS positive model. Mixed exposures were not associated with any of allergic symptoms in the WQS negative model or qg-computation approach. However, the combined effects of exposure to two PFRs suggested an additive and/or multiplicative interaction, potentially increasing the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis. A further study with a larger sample size is needed to confirm these results.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between occupational exposures to rubber dust, rubber fumes and N-nitrosamines and non-cancer mortality. METHODS: A cohort of 36 441 males aged 35+ years employed in British rubber factories was followed-up to 2015 (94% deceased). Competing risk survival analysis was used to assess risks of dying from non-cancer diseases (respiratory, urinary, cerebrovascular, circulatory and digestive diseases). Occupational exposures to rubber dust, rubber fumes, N-nitrosamines were derived based on a population-specific quantitative job-exposure matrix which in-turn was based on measurements in the EU-EXASRUB database. RESULTS: Exposure-response associations of increased risk with increasing exposure were found for N-nitrosomorpholine with mortality from circulatory diseases (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 1.17; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.23), ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (SHR 1.19; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.26), cerebrovascular disease (SHR 1.19; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.32) and exposures to N-nitrosodimethylamine with respiratory disease mortality (SHR 1.41; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.53). Increased risks for mortality from circulatory disease, IHD and digestive diseases were found with higher levels of exposures to rubber dust, rubber fumes and N-nitrosamines sum, without an exposure-dependent manner. No associations were observed between rubber dust, rubber fumes and N-nitrosamines exposures with mortality from asthma, urinary disease, bronchitis, emphysema, liver disease and some digestive diseases. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of rubber factory workers with 49 years of follow-up, increased risk for mortality from circulatory, cerebrovascular, respiratory and digestive diseases were found to be associated with cumulative occupational exposures to specific agents.},

@article{Morton_2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the most common hematologic malignancy, consists of numerous subtypes. The etiology of NHL is incompletely understood, and increasing evidence suggests that risk factors may vary by NHL subtype. However, small numbers of cases have made investigation of subtype-specific risks challenging. The International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium therefore undertook the NHL Subtypes Project, an international collaborative effort to investigate the etiologies of NHL subtypes. This article describes in detail the project rationale and design. METHODS: We pooled individual-level data from 20 case-control studies (17471 NHL cases, 23096 controls) from North America, Europe, and Australia. Centralized data harmonization and analysis ensured standardized definitions and approaches, with rigorous quality control. RESULTS: The pooled study population included 11 specified NHL subtypes with more than 100 cases: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (N = 4667), follicular lymphoma (N = 3530), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (N = 2440), marginal zone lymphoma (N = 1052), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (N = 584), mantle cell lymphoma (N = 557), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstr{\"o}m macroglobulinemia (N = 374), mycosis fungoides/S{\'e}zary syndrome (N = 324), Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma/leukemia (N = 295), hairy cell leukemia (N = 154), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (N = 152). Associations with medical history, family history, lifestyle factors, and occupation for each of these 11 subtypes are presented in separate articles in this issue, with a final article quantitatively comparing risk factor patterns among subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium NHL Subtypes Project provides the largest and most comprehensive investigation of potential risk factors for a broad range of common and rare NHL subtypes to date. The analyses contribute to our understanding of the multifactorial nature of NHL subtype etiologies, motivate hypothesis-driven prospective investigations, provide clues for prevention, and exemplify the benefits of international consortial collaboration in cancer epidemiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: If less healthy workers terminate employment earlier, thus accumulating less exposure, yet remain at greater risk of the health outcome, estimated health effects of cumulative exposure will be biased downward. If exposure also affects termination of employment, then the bias cannot be addressed using conventional methods. We examined these conditions as a prelude to a reanalysis of lung cancer mortality in the Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study. METHODS: We applied an accelerated failure time model to assess the effect of exposures to respirable elemental carbon (a surrogate for diesel) on time to termination of employment among nonmetal miners who ever worked underground (n = 8,307). We then applied the parametric g-formula to assess how possible interventions setting respirable elemental carbon exposure limits would have changed lifetime risk of lung cancer, adjusting for time-varying employment status. RESULTS: Median time to termination was 36% shorter (95% confidence interval = 33%, 39%), per interquartile range width increase in respirable elemental carbon exposure. Lung cancer risk decreased with more stringent interventions, with a risk ratio of 0.8 (95% confidence interval = 0.5, 1.1) comparing a limit of </=25 microg/m respirable elemental carbon to no intervention. The fraction of cases attributable to diesel exposure was 27% in this population. CONCLUSIONS: The g-formula controlled for time-varying confounding by employment status, the signature of healthy worker survivor bias, which was also affected by diesel exposure. It also offers an alternative approach to risk assessment for estimating excess cumulative risk, and the impact of interventions based entirely on an observed population.},

	abstract = {Cohort mortality studies of underground miners have been used to estimate the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to radon exposure. However, previous studies of the radon-lung cancer association among underground miners may have been subject to healthy worker survivor bias, a type of time-varying confounding by employment status. We examined radon-mortality associations in a study of 4,124 male uranium miners from the Colorado Plateau who were followed from 1950 through 2005. We estimated the time ratio (relative change in median survival time) per 100 working level months (radon exposure averaging 130,000 mega-electron volts of potential alpha energy per liter of air, per working month) using G-estimation of structural nested models. After controlling for healthy worker survivor bias, the time ratio for lung cancer per 100 working level months was 1.168 (95% confidence interval: 1.152, 1.174). In an unadjusted model, the estimate was 1.102 (95% confidence interval: 1.099, 1.112)-39% lower. Controlling for this bias, we estimated that among 617 lung cancer deaths, 6,071 person-years of life were lost due to occupational radon exposure during follow-up. Our analysis suggests that healthy worker survivor bias in miner cohort studies can be substantial, warranting reexamination of current estimates of radon's estimated impact on lung cancer mortality.},

	abstract = {Ischemic heart disease (IHD) has been linked to exposures to airborne particles with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) in the ambient environment and in occupational settings. Routine industrial exposure monitoring, however, has traditionally focused on total particulate matter (TPM). To assess potential benefits of PM2.5 monitoring, we compared the exposure-response relationships between both PM2.5 and TPM and incidence of IHD in a cohort of active aluminum industry workers. To account for the presence of time varying confounding by health status we applied marginal structural Cox models in a cohort followed with medical claims data for IHD incidence from 1998 to 2012. Analyses were stratified by work process into smelters (n = 6,579) and fabrication (n = 7,432). Binary exposure was defined by the 10th-percentile cut-off from the respective TPM and PM2.5 exposure distributions for each work process. Hazard Ratios (HR) comparing always exposed above the exposure cut-off to always exposed below the cut-off were higher for PM2.5, with HRs of 1.70 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11--2.60) and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.02--2.13) in smelters and fabrication, respectively. For TPM, the HRs were 1.25 (95% CI: 0.89--1.77) and 1.25 (95% CI: 0.88--1.77) for smelters and fabrication respectively. Although TPM and PM2.5 were highly correlated in this work environment, results indicate that, consistent with biologic plausibility, PM2.5 is a stronger predictor of IHD risk than TPM. Cardiovascular risk management in the aluminum industry, and other similar work environments, could be better guided by exposure surveillance programs monitoring PM2.5.},

Occupational exposure limits for silica are derived from a number of lines of evidence, including observational studies. Observational studies may be subject to healthy worker survivor bias, which could result in underestimates of silica's impact on worker mortality and, in turn, bias risk estimates for occupational exposure limits. Methods: Using data on 65,999 workers pooled across multiple industries, we estimate the impacts of several hypothetical occupational exposure limits on silica exposure on lung cancer and all-cause mortality. We use the parametric g-formula, which can account for healthy worker survivor bias. Results: Assuming we could eliminate occupational exposure, we estimate that there would be 20.7 fewer deaths per 1,000 workers in our pooled study by age 80 (95% confidence interval = 14.5, 26.8), including 3.91 fewer deaths owing to lung cancer (95% CI = 1.53, 6.30). Less restrictive interventions demonstrated smaller but still substantial risk reductions. Conclusions: Our results suggest that occupational exposure limits for silica can be further strengthened to reduce silica-associated mortality and illustrate how current risk analysis for occupational limits can be improved.},

@article{Siebert_2001,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential of a healthy worker survivor effect due to differential occupational mobility in a cohort of construction workers. METHODS: A cohort of 10 809 male employees in the German construction industry aged 15-64 years was followed up for occupational mobility, early retirement due to permanent disability, and total mortality from 1986 to 1994. Using the Cox's proportional hazards model of relative rates (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of occupational mobility, early retirement and total mortality were estimated according to medical diagnoses at baseline after adjustment for various covariates. RESULTS: During follow up, 2472 subjects changed employment, 359 employees were granted a disability pension for health reasons and 188 subjects died. A wide range of chronic diseases was associated with increased rates of early retirement and total mortality but not occupational mobility. However, a healthy worker survivor effect was identified related to disorders of the back and spine (ninth revision of the international classification of diseases, ICD-9, code 720-4), a common predictor of both occupational mobility (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.32) and early retirement (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.88). In total, there were about as many events of occupational changes (n = 41) as events of early retirement due to permanent disability (n = 39) significantly attributable to disorders of the back and spine. Differential occupational mobility preceded differential early retirement due to permanent disability by more than one decade. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the need to consider a healthy worker survivor effect due to occupational mobility in occupational epidemiological research. Furthermore these results underline the necessity of further health promotion targeting work related conditions in the construction industry.},

	abstract = {In occupational epidemiologic studies, the healthy worker survivor effect refers to a process that leads to bias in the estimates of an association between cumulative exposure and a health outcome. In these settings, work status acts both as an intermediate and confounding variable and may violate the positivity assumption (the presence of exposed and unexposed observations in all strata of the confounder). Using Monte Carlo simulation, we assessed the degree to which crude, work-status adjusted, and weighted (marginal structural) Cox proportional hazards models are biased in the presence of time-varying confounding and nonpositivity. We simulated the data representing time-varying occupational exposure, work status, and mortality. Bias, coverage, and root mean squared error (MSE) were calculated relative to the true marginal exposure effect in a range of scenarios. For a base-case scenario, using crude, adjusted, and weighted Cox models, respectively, the hazard ratio was biased downward 19{\%}, 9{\%}, and 6{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval coverage was 48{\%}, 85{\%}, and 91{\%}; and root MSE was 0.20, 0.13, and 0.11. Although marginal structural models were less biased in most scenarios studied, neither standard nor marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models fully resolve the bias encountered under conditions of time-varying confounding and nonpositivity.},

	abstract = {Due to the heavy and expanding agricultural use of neurotoxic pesticides suspected to affect dopaminergic neurons, it is imperative to closely examine the role of pesticides in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). We focus our investigation on pesticide use in California's heavily agricultural central valley by utilizing a unique pesticide use reporting system. From 2001 to 2007, we enrolled 362 incident PD cases and 341 controls living in the Central Valley of California. Employing our geographic information system model, we estimated ambient exposures to the pesticides ziram, maneb, and paraquat at work places and residences from 1974 to 1999. At workplaces, combined exposure to ziram, maneb, and paraquat increased risk of PD three-fold (OR: 3.09; 95{\%} CI: 1.69, 5.64) and combined exposure to ziram and paraquat, excluding maneb exposure, was associated with a 80{\%} increase in risk (OR:1.82; 95{\%} CI: 1.03, 3.21). Risk estimates for ambient workplace exposure were greater than for exposures at residences and were especially high for younger onset PD patients and when exposed in both locations. Our study is the first to implicate ziram in PD etiology. Combined ambient exposure to ziram and paraquat as well as combined ambient exposure to maneb and paraquat at both workplaces and residences increased PD risk substantially. Those exposed to ziram, maneb, and paraquat together experienced the greatest increase in PD risk. Our results suggest that pesticides affecting different mechanisms that contribute to dopaminergic neuron death may act together to increase the risk of PD considerably.},

	abstract = {Abstract There is considerable variation in the phenotypic appearance of individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), which may translate into differences in disease progression in addition to underlying disease etiology. In this publication, we report on the demographic and clinical characteristics of 162 individuals diagnosed with clinically probable PD from January 1998 to June 2003 who resided in predominantly rural communities in central California. The majority of the subjects were Caucasian, male, and between 60 and 79 years of age. The akinetic--rigid and tremor‐dominant subtypes were more common than the mixed subtype. The majority of subjects displayed motor signs of rigidity (92.0\%), bradykinesia (95.7\%), and gait problems (87.0\%), whereas less than half (43.3\%) of the subjects displayed a tremor. Three fourths of patients received a Hoehn and Yahr Scale score of Stage 2 or higher. One third of the patients were treated with levodopa, and patients under 60 years of age were more likely to be treated with dopamine agonists. Within 3 years after first diagnosis, 13\% of subjects showed some signs of depression and 17\% of subjects met criteria for mild dementia. Among our subjects, 17.3\% reported a family history of PD in first‐ or second‐degree relatives,15.4\% a family history of essential tremor, and 14.2\% of Alzheimer's disease. This study represents the most extensive phenotypic description of rural U.S. residents in the initial stages of PD who were recruited in a population‐based manner; future follow‐up may provide valuable information regarding the prognostic indication of these symptoms/signs and improve our understanding of the underlying etiology of PD. {\copyright} 2005 Movement Disorder Society},

@article{Mark_2014,
	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the possible reduced risk of Parkinson Disease (PD) due to coffee, alcohol, and/or cigarette consumption. In addition, we explored the potential effect modification by intensity, duration and time-since-cessation of smoking on the association between cumulative pack-years of cigarette smoking (total smoking) and PD risk. Data of a hospital based case-control study was used including 444 PD patients, diagnosed between 2006 and 2011, and 876 matched controls from 5 hospitals in the Netherlands. A novel modeling method was applied to derive unbiased estimates of the potential modifying effects of smoking intensity, duration, and time-since-cessation by conditioning on total exposure. We observed no reduced risk of PD by alcohol consumption and only a weak inverse association between coffee consumption and PD risk. However, a strong inverse association of total smoking with PD risk was observed (OR = 0.27 (95%CI: 0.18--0.42) for never smokers versus highest quartile of tobacco use). The observed protective effect of total smoking was significantly modified by time-since-cessation with a diminishing protective effect after cessation of smoking. No effect modification by intensity or duration of smoking was observed indicating that both intensity and duration have an equal contribution to the reduced PD risk. Understanding the dynamics of the protective effect of smoking on PD risk aids in understanding PD etiology and may contribute to strategies for prevention and treatment.},

@article{Rice_2001,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To use various exposure-response models to estimate the risk of mortality from lung cancer due to occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica dust. METHODS Data from a cohort mortality study of 2342 white male California diatomaceous earth mining and processing workers exposed to crystalline silica dust (mainly cristobalite) were reanalyzed with Poisson regression and Cox{\textquoteright}s proportional hazards models. Internal and external adjustments were used to control for potential confounding from the effects of time since first observation, calendar time, age, and Hispanic ethnicity. Cubic smoothing spline models were used to assess the fit of the models. Exposures were lagged by 10 years. Evaluations of the fit of the models were performed by comparing their deviances. Lifetime risks of lung cancer were estimated up to age 85 with an actuarial approach that accounted for competing causes of death. RESULTS Exposure to respirable crystalline silica dust was a significant predictor (p\&lt;0.05) in nearly all of the models evaluated and the linear relative rate model with a 10 year exposure lag seemed to give the best fit in the Poisson regression analysis. For those who died of lung cancer the linear relative rate model predicted rate ratios for mortality from lung cancer of about 1.6 for the mean cumulative exposure to respirable silica compared with no exposure. The excess lifetime risk (to age 85) of mortality from lung cancer for white men exposed for 45 years and with a 10 year lag period at the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard of about 0.05 mg/m3 for respirable cristobalite dust is 19/1000 (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 5/1000 to 46/1000). CONCLUSIONS There was a significant risk of mortality from lung cancer that increased with cumulative exposure to respirable crystalline silica dust. The predicted number of deaths from lung cancer suggests that current occupational health standards may not be adequately protecting workers from the risk of lung cancer.},

@article{Arrighi_1994,
	abstract = {The "healthy worker survivor effect" describes a continuing selection process such that those who remain employed tend to be healthier than those who leave employment. In an analysis of exposure-response patterns in an occupational study, the healthy worker survivor effect generally attenuates an adverse effect of exposure. In practical terms, such attenuation will be more problematic when evaluating subtle rather than strong associations. The use of an internal referent does not guarantee elimination of this effect, since by definition, it manifests within an occupational cohort. Although documented over 100 years ago, there is little consensus regarding the most appropriate method to control for the healthy worker survivor effect. Four methods have been proposed for its control: (1) restriction of the cohort to survivors of a fixed number of years of follow-up, (2) lagging the exposure to exclude recent exposure incurred by those who remained on the job, (3) adjusting for employment status as a confounder, and (4) treating the healthy worker survivor effect simultaneously as an intermediate and confounding variable by means of the G-null test or its extension, G-estimation analysis, using structurally nested failure time models. This paper reviews the concept of the healthy worker survivor effect and the four methods to control for it.},

@article{Dumas_2013,
	abstract = {Objectives The healthy worker effect usually leads to underestimation of the association between occupational exposure and asthma. The role of irritants in work-related asthma is disputed. We estimated the effect of occupational exposure on asthma expression in a longitudinal study, using marginal structural modelling to control for the healthy worker effect. Methods Analyses included 1284 participants (17{\textendash}79 years, 48\% men) from the follow-up (2003{\textendash}2007) of the French Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (case-control study). Age at asthma onset, periods with/without attacks over lifetime and occupational history were recorded retrospectively. Exposures to known asthmagens, irritants or low level of chemicals/allergens were evaluated through a job-exposure matrix. The job history was reconstructed into 5-year intervals. Results Thirty-one per cent of subjects had ever been exposed to occupational asthmagens. Among the 38\% of subjects who had asthma (ever), presence of attacks was reported in 52\% of all time periods. Using standard analyses, no association was observed between exposure to known asthmagens (OR (95\% CI): 0.99 (0.72 to 1.36)) or to irritants/low level of chemicals/allergens (0.82 (0.56 to 1.20)) and asthma attacks. Using a marginal structural model, all associations increased with suggestive evidence for known asthmagens (1.26 (0.90 to 1.76)), and reaching statistical significance for irritants/low level of chemicals/allergens (1.56 (1.02 to 2.40)). Conclusions The healthy worker effect has an important impact in risk assessment in work-related asthma studies. Marginal structural models are useful to eliminate imbalances in exposure due to disease-driven selection. Results support the role of irritants in work-related asthma.},

@article{Picciotto_2013,
	abstract = {Objectives The healthy worker survivor effect is a bias that occurs in occupational studies when less healthy workers are more likely to reduce their workplace exposures. When variables on the pathway from health status to exposure are measured, g-methods can avoid this bias. However, studies in which follow-up ends at employment termination have additional potential for selection bias. This paper examines the structure of the healthy worker survivor effect, compares results with and without censoring at employment termination, and addresses how to prevent bias when such censoring occurs. Methods G-estimation of structural accelerated failure time models was applied in the United Autoworkers{\textemdash}General Motors cohort study to examine relationships between metalworking fluid exposure and cause-specific mortality. Subjects were followed from hire through 1994, regardless of employment status. To answer the central question, g-estimation analysis was repeated after truncating at employment termination and censoring outcomes that occurred thereafter, with adjustment for censoring by inverse probability weighting. Results Using full follow-up time, HRs were estimated for all-cause mortality (1.09), ischaemic heart disease death (1.19), and death from any cancer (1.09), comparing 5 years of metalworking fluid exposure to no exposure. For all three outcomes, the HR estimates based on data censored at termination of employment were below 1 (respectively, 0.92, 0.97, 0.79). Conclusions In this application, g-estimation together with weighting did not prevent selection bias due to employment termination. However, the bias might be avoided in studies with measured health-related variables on the pathway from health status to employment termination.},

@article{Friesen_2007,
	abstract = {{Background: Exposure misclassification. may occur when nonspecific
   exposure indicators are used. Developing estimates of more specific
   measures may be difficult due to sampling limitations or a paucity of
   historical measurements and, thus, often requires substantial effort. We
   examine the impact on exposure-response relationships of moving from 2
   measures of exposure mixtures (dust, chlorophenols) to more specific
   exposure indicators (wood dust, pentachlorophenol,.tetrachlorophenol) in
   a retrospective cohort.
   Methods: The study population consisted of 26,847 male sawmill workers
   (>= 1 year employment between 1950 and 1995) with linkage to national
   cancer registries. A subcohort (n = 11,273 employed more than 1 day
   between 1985 and 1995) was linked to hospital discharge records. We
   evaluated the shape (log-linear vs log-log models), goodness of fit,
   precision, and expected versus observed attenuation of the
   exposure-response relationships.
   Results: The correlation between the cumulative exposure indices was
   moderately high (dust/wood dust, r = 0.68; total chlorophenol/
   pentachlorophenol, r = 0.88; total chlorophenol/tetrachlorophenol, r =
   0.78). An increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   hospitalizations was found with wood dust but not with total dust.
   Stronger associations for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and kidney cancer
   incidence were observed with pentachlorophenol than with total
   chlorophenol; no association was observed with tetrachlorophenol. We
   observed greater attenuation than expected using total dust, but less
   than expected using total chlorophenol.
   Conclusions: The relationships between health outcomes were
   substantially attenuated when nonspecific exposure indicators were used.
   This study demonstrates the importance of developing exposure metrics as
   specific to the disease-causing agent as possible, particularly when the
   composition of mixed exposures varies by work areas.}},

@article{Blair_2007,
	abstract = {Confounding and exposure misclassification are issues that concern epidemiologists because of their potential to bias results of studies and complicate interpretations. In occupational epidemiology both are routinely raised to argue that an observed result is either a false positive or a false negative finding. Although it is important to consider the potential for limitations of epidemiologic investigations, judgment regarding their importance should be based on their actual likelihood of occurrence.
This paper is based on our experience in epidemiologic analyses and a brief review of the literature regarding confounding and exposure misclassification.
Examples of substantial confounding are rare in occupational epidemiology. In fact, even for studies of occupational exposures and lung cancer, tobacco-adjusted relative risks rarely differ appreciably from the unadjusted estimates. This is surprising because it seems the perfect situation for confounding to occur. Yet, despite the lack of evidence that confounding is a common problem, nearly every epidemiologic paper includes a lengthy discussion on uncontrolled or residual confounding. On the other hand, exposure misclassification probably occurs in all studies. The only question is, how much? The direction and magnitude of nondifferential exposure misclassification (the type most likely to occur in cohort studies) on estimates of relative risks can be largely predicted given knowledge on the degree of misclassification, that is, relatively small amounts of misclassification can bias relative risks substantially towards the null. The literature, however, is full of discussions implying that misclassification of exposure is an explanation for a positive finding.
These comments are not to suggest that all potential limitations for epidemiologic studies should not be considered and evaluated. We do believe, however, that the likelihood of occurrence and the direction and magnitude of the effect should be more carefully and realistically considered when making judgments about study design or data interpretation.

   treatment effects. Control of confounding, however, remains challenging.
   The authors compared five methods for evaluating the effect of tissue
   plasminogen activator on death among 6,269 ischemic stroke patients
   registered in a German stroke registry: multivariable logistic
   regression, propensity score-matched analysis, regression adjustment
   with the propensity score, and two propensity score-based weighted
   methods-one estimating the treatment effect in the entire study
   population (inverse-probability-of-treatment weights), another in the
   treated population (standardized-mortality-ratio weights). Between 2000
   and 2001, 212 patients received tissue plasminogen activator. The crude
   odds ratio between tissue plasminogen activator and death was 3.35 (95\%
   confidence interval: 2.28, 4.91). The adjusted odds ratio depended
   strongly on the adjustment method, ranging from 1.11 (95\% confidence
   interval: 0.67, 1.84) for the standardized-mortality-ratio weighted to
   10.77 (95\% confidence interval: 2.47, 47.04) for the
   inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted analysis. For treated patients
   with a low propensity score, risks of dying were high. Exclusion of
   patients with a propensity score of <5\% yielded comparable odds ratios
   of approximately 1 for all methods. High levels of nonuniform treatment
   effect render summary estimates very sensitive to the weighting system

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND: A large and growing literature investigating the role of
   extreme heat on mortality has conceptualized the role of ambient ozone
   in various ways, sometimes treating it as a confounder, sometimes as an
   effect modifier, and sometimes as a co-exposure. Thus, there is a lack
   of consensus about the roles that temperature and ozone together play in
   causing mortality.
   OBJECTIVES: We applied directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to the topic of
   heat-related mortality to graphically represent the subject matter
   behind the research questions and to provide insight on the analytical
   options available.
   DISCUSSION: On the basis of the subject matter encoded in the graphs, we
   assert that the role of ozone in studies of temperature and mortality is
   a causal intermediate that is affected by temperature and that can also
   affect mortality, rather than a confounder.
   CONCLUSIONS: We discuss possible questions of interest implied by this
   causal structure and propose areas of future work to further clarify the
   role of air pollutants in epidemiologic studies of extreme temperature.}},

   with cardiovascular disease, and disadvantaged status may increase
   susceptibility to air pollution-related health effects. In addition,
   there are concerns that this association may be partially explained by
   confounding by socioeconomic status (SES).
   Objectives: We examined the roles that individual-and neighborhood-level
   SES (NSES) play in the association between PM2.5 exposure and
   cardiovascular disease.
   Methods: The study population comprised 51,754 postmenopausal women from
   the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. PM2.5 concentrations
   were predicted at participant residences using fine-scale regionalized
   universal kriging models. We assessed individual-level SES and NSES

   occupation, and income/wealth, as well as through an NSES score, which
   captures several important dimensions of SES. Cox proportional-hazards
   regression adjusted for SES factors and other covariates to determine
   the risk of a first cardiovascular event.
   Results: A 5 mu g/m(3) higher exposure to PM2.5 was associated with a
   13\% increased risk of cardiovascular event {[}hazard ratio (HR) 1.13;
   95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.26]. Adjustment for SES factors
   did not meaningfully affect the risk estimate. Higher risk estimates

   most and least disadvantaged quartiles of the NSES score had HRs of 1.39
   (95\% CI: 1.21, 1.61) and 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.72, 1.07), respectively.
   Conclusions: Women with lower NSES may be more susceptible to air

   at environmental concentrations increases the risk of cardiovascular
   disease, particularly PM with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5
   mu m (PM2.5). Despite this, the health impacts of higher occupational
   exposures to PM2.5 have rarely been evaluated. In part, this research
   gap derives from the absence of information on PM2.5 exposures in the
   workplace. To address this gap, we have developed a job-exposure matrix
   (JEM) to estimate exposure to two size fractions of PM in the aluminum
   industry. Measurements of total PM (TPM) and PM2.5 were used to develop
   exposure metrics for an epidemiologic study. TPM exposures for distinct
   exposure groups (DEGs) in the JEM were calculated using 8385 personal
   TPM samples collected at 11 facilities (1980-2011). For eight of these
   facilities, simultaneous PM2.5 and TPM personal monitoring was conducted
   from 2010 to 2011 to determine the percent of TPM that is composed of
   PM2.5 (\%PM2.5) in each DEG. The mean TPM from the JEM was then
   multiplied by \%PM2.5 to calculate PM2.5 exposure concentrations in each
   DEG. Exposures in the smelters were substantially higher than in
   fabrication units; mean TPM concentrations in smelters and fabrication
   facilities were 3.86 and 0.76 mg/m(3), and the corresponding mean PM2.5

	abstract = {{Background: Air pollution may be related to adverse birth outcomes.
   Exposure information from land-based monitoring stations often suffers
   from limited spatial coverage. Satellite data offer an alternative data
   source for exposure assessment.
   Methods: We used birth certificate data for births in Connecticut and
   Massachusetts, United States (2000-2006). Gestational exposure to PM2.5
   was estimated from US Environmental Protection Agency monitoring data
   and from satellite data. Satellite data were processed and modeled by
   using two methodsdenoted satellite (1) and satellite (2)before exposure
   assessment. Regression models related PM2.5 exposure to birth outcomes
   while controlling for several confounders. Birth outcomes were mean
   birth weight at term birth, low birth weight at term (<2500 g), small
   for gestational age (SGA, <10th percentile for gestational age and sex),
   and preterm birth (<37 weeks).
   Results: Overall, the exposure assessment method modified the magnitude
   of the effect estimates of PM2.5 on birth outcomes. Change in birth
   weight per interquartile range (2.41 g/m(3)) increase in PM2.5 was -6 g
   (95\% confidence interval = -8 to -5), -16 g (-21 to -11), and -19 g
   (-23 to -15), using the monitor, satellite (1), and satellite (2)
   methods, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios, based on the same three
   exposure methods, for term low birth weight were 1.01 (0.98-1.04), 1.06
   (0.97-1.16), and 1.08 (1.01-1.16); for SGA, 1.03 (1.01-1.04), 1.06
   (1.03-1.10), and 1.08 (1.04-1.11); and for preterm birth, 1.00
   (0.99-1.02), 0.98 (0.94-1.03), and 0.99 (0.95-1.03).
   Conclusions: Under exposure assessment methods, we found associations
   between PM2.5 exposure and adverse birth outcomes particularly for birth
   weight among term births and for SGA. These results add to the growing
   concerns that air pollution adversely affects infant health and suggest
   that analysis of health consequences based on satellite-based exposure
   assessment can provide additional useful information.}},

	abstract = {Background: Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter less than 2·5 μm in diameter (PM2·5) and traffic-related air pollutant concentrations are associated with cardiovascular risk. The disease process underlying these associations remains uncertain. We aim to assess association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and progression of coronary artery calcium and common carotid artery intima-media thickness. Methods: In this prospective 10-year cohort study, we repeatedly measured coronary artery calcium by CT in 6795 participants aged 45-84 years enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air) in six metropolitan areas in the USA. Repeated scans were done for nearly all participants between 2002 and 2005, for a subset of participants between 2005 and 2007, and for half of all participants between 2010 and 2012. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured by ultrasound in all participants at baseline and in 2010-12 for 3459 participants. Residence-specific spatio-temporal pollution concentration models, incorporating community-specific measurements, agency monitoring data, and geographical predictors, estimated concentrations of PM2·5 and nitrogen oxides (NOX) between 1999 and 2012. The primary aim was to examine the association between both progression of coronary artery calcium and mean carotid artery intima-media thickness and long-term exposure to ambient air pollutant concentrations (PM2·5, NOX, and black carbon) between examinations and within the six metropolitan areas, adjusting for baseline age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, site, and CT scanner technology. Findings: In this population, coronary calcium increased on average by 24 Agatston units per year (SD 58), and intima-media thickness by 12 μm per year (10), before adjusting for risk factors or air pollutant exposures. Participant-specific pollutant concentrations averaged over the years 2000-10 ranged from 9·2-22·6 μg PM2·5/m3 and 7·2-139·2 parts per billion (ppb) NOX. For each 5 μg PM2·5/m3 increase, coronary calcium progressed by 4·1 Agatston units per year (95% CI 1·4-6·8) and for each 40 ppb NOX coronary calcium progressed by 4·8 Agatston units per year (0·9-8·7). Pollutant exposures were not associated with intima-media thickness change. The estimate for the effect of a 5 μg/m3 higher long-term exposure to PM2·5 in intima-media thickness was -0·9 μm per year (95% CI -3·0 to 1·3). For 40 ppb higher NOX, the estimate was 0·2 μm per year (-1·9 to 2·4). Interpretation: Increased concentrations of PM2·5 and traffic-related air pollution within metropolitan areas, in ranges commonly encountered worldwide, are associated with progression in coronary calcification, consistent with acceleration of atherosclerosis. This study supports the case for global efforts of pollution reduction in prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Funding: US Environmental Protection Agency and US National Institutes of Health.},

We explore relationships with the other air pollution risk factors: ambient air pollution, smoking, and secondhand smoke.

	abstract = { Rationale: Evidence supporting the association of COPD or airflow obstruction with use of solid fuels is conflicting and inconsistent. Objective: To assess the association of airflow obstruction with self-reported use of solid fuels for cooking or heating. Methods: We analysed 18,554 adults from the BOLD study, who had provided acceptable post-bronchodilator spirometry measurements and information on use of solid fuels. The association of airflow obstruction with use of solid fuels for cooking or heating was assessed by sex, within each site, using regression analysis. Estimates were stratified by national income and meta-analysed. We carried out similar analyses for spirometric restriction, chronic cough and chronic phlegm. Measurements and main results: We found no association between airflow obstruction and use of solid fuels for cooking or heating (ORmen=1.20, 95\%CI 0.94-1.53; ORwomen=0.88, 95\%CI 0.67-1.15). This was true for low/middle and high income sites. Among never smokers there was also no evidence of an association of airflow obstruction with use of solid fuels (ORmen=1.00, 95\%CI 0.57-1.76; ORwomen=1.00, 95\%CI 0.76-1.32). Overall, we found no association of spirometric restriction, chronic cough or chronic phlegm with the use of solid fuels. However, we found that chronic phlegm was more likely to be reported among female never smokers and those who had been exposed for ≥20 years. Conclusion: Airflow obstruction assessed from post-bronchodilator spirometry was not associated with use of solid fuels for cooking or heating. },

@article{Janes_2005,
	abstract = {The case-crossover design has been widely used to study the association between short-term air pollution exposure and the risk of an acute adverse health event. The design uses cases only; for each individual case, exposure just before the event is compared with exposure at other control (or "referent") times. Time-invariant confounders are controlled by making within-subject comparisons. Even more important in the air pollution setting is that time-varying confounders can also be controlled by design by matching referents to the index time. The referent selection strategy is important for reasons in addition to control of confounding. The case-crossover design makes the implicit assumption that there is no trend in exposure across the referent times. In addition, the statistical method that is used--conditional logistic regression--is unbiased only with certain referent strategies. We review here the case-crossover literature in the air pollution context, focusing on key issues regarding referent selection. We conclude with a set of recommendations for choosing a referent strategy with air pollution exposure data. Specifically, we advocate the time-stratified approach to referent selection because it ensures unbiased conditional logistic regression estimates, avoids bias resulting from time trend in the exposure series, and can be tailored to match on specific time-varying confounders.},

@article{Basu_2005,
	abstract = {Background: Time-series analyses have been used for decades to investigate time-varying environmental exposures. Recently, the case-crossover design has been applied to assess acute effects of air pollution. Our objective was to compare time-series and case-crossover analyses using varying referent periods (ie, unidirectional, ambidirectional, and time-stratified). Methods: We examined the association between temperature and cardiorespiratory mortality among the elderly population in the 20 largest metropolitan areas of the United States. Risks were estimated by season and geographic region in 1992. We obtained weather data from the National Climatic Data Center and mortality data from the Division of Vital Statistics. Conditional logistic regression (case-crossover) and Poisson regression (time-series) were used to estimate the increased risk of cardiorespiratory mortality associated with a 10$\,^{\circ}$F increase in daily temperature, accounting for dew-point temperature and other potential confounding factors. Results: In the time-stratified case-crossover analysis, the strongest associations were found in the summer; in the Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, Northeast, and Midwest, the odds ratios were 1.15 (95% confidence interval = 1.07-1.24), 1.10 (0.96-1.27), 1.08 (0.92-1.26), 1.08 (1.02-1.15), and 1.01 (0.92-1.11), respectively. Mostly null or negative associations were found in the winter, spring, and fall. The ambidirectional case-crossover and the time-series analyses produced quantitatively similar results to those from the time-stratified analysis. The unidirectional analysis produced conflicting results. Conclusions: Inferences from studies of weather and mortality using the ambidirectional or time-stratified case-crossover approaches and the time-series analyses are comparable and provide consistent findings in this study.},

@article{Zanobetti_2008,
	abstract = {Background: Extreme temperatures have been associated with increased mortality worldwide. The extent to which air pollutants may confound or modify this association remains unclear. Methods: We examined the association between mean apparent temperature and total mortality in 9 cities across the United States during the warm season (May to September) from 1999 to 2002. We applied case-crossover and time-series analyses, adjusting for day of the week and season in time-series analysis. City-specific estimates were then combined using a meta-analysis. A total of 213,438 deaths for all causes occurred in these cities during the study period. Results: We found that mortality increased with apparent temperature. A 5.5$\,^{\circ}$C (10$\,^{\circ}$F) increase in apparent temperature was associated with an increase in mortality of 1.8% (95% confidence interval = 1.09% to 2.5%) when using case-crossover analysis and with an increase of 2.7% (2.0% to 3.5%) using the time-series analysis. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of increased mortality due to elevated apparent temperature exposure, with no confounding or effect modification due to air pollution.},
